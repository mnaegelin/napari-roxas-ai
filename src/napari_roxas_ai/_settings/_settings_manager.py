    Manages plugin settings, including loading, saving, and accessing settings.

    exists throughout the application. This guarantees that settings are
    consistent across all components of the plugin.

    The settings are stored in a JSON file located in the _settings module
    directory. The file is automatically created with default values if it
    doesn't exist.
